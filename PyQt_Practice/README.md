## PyQt Practice
### Rykir Evans
### Description:

This folder exhibits use of the PyQt Framework for basic UI development. This is to facilitate familiarity with the framework before contributing to a larger project for NASA SUITS development, which emphasizes the use and development of a robust UI. There are two simple programs in this folder, one for the tradition `Hello World!` introductory program, and another which is meant to start the foundation for other team members to edit and add their own buttons which will display their name.
