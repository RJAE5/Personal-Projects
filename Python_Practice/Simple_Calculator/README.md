### Description:

This portion of my Python learning journey showcases the first simple project that I decided to embark on. It utlizes a basic interaction with the user to obtain two numbers and perform a desired calculation based on the user's request. It has an basic error handling for operations such as dividing by zero. This program was made to reinforce the usage of conditionals, simple comparisons, error checking, and formatted strings.
